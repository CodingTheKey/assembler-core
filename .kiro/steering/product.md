# Product Overview

Assembleo Core is a NestJS-based API for managing assemblies and meetings. The system handles three main entities:

- **Unities**: Organizations or groups that hold meetings
- **Associates**: Members who belong to unities and participate in meetings  
- **Meetings**: Events organized by unities with associate participation

The application provides CRUD operations for managing these entities, with features like:
- Associate registration and management within unities
- Meeting scheduling and participant tracking
- Unity administration with address and branding support

This is a backend API service designed to support assembly management workflows, likely for cooperative organizations, unions, or similar democratic institutions.
